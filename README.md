# Automation-Katalon-Studio

Website : https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com/

The Automation script is created for objects, test data, test cases, and scripts are easy to manage and can be reusable.

In this automation project, we already have:
1. Set Profiles for environment test (base URL, test data, global variable)
2. Reusable test cases
3. Foldering for objects
4. Dynamic objects using variable
5. Test suites to execute all test cases
6. Test suite collections to run on multiple browsers
